                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><em>Last Updated: September 5, 2025</em></p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Huge Holdings. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information in relation to our mobile games and software services ("Services"). This policy applies to all users of our Services.</p>

                <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

                <h4>A. Information You Provide to Us</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>Newsletter Subscription:</strong> The only personal information we actively collect is the email address you voluntarily provide when you subscribe to our newsletter. We use this information solely to send you updates, news, and marketing communications about our games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may opt-out of receiving these communications at any time. Every email we send via our provider, Mailchimp, includes an "Unsubscribe" link. You may also contact us directly at <a href="mailto:hugeholdings@hotmail.com">hugeholdings@hotmail.com</a> to request removal from our mailing list. We will process your request within a reasonable timeframe.
                </p>

                <h4>B. Data We May Collect Automatically (Analytics)</h4>
                <p>
                    To improve our games and provide a better experience, we may in the future integrate third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics. These services may automatically collect anonymous information, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.</li>
                    <li>Your IP address and general geographic location.</li>
                    <li>In-game activity, session duration, and usage patterns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data is collected in an aggregated, anonymous form and is used for internal analysis to help us understand how our Services are being used and how we can improve them.</p>

                <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Protecting the privacy of children is extremely important to us. Our Services are intended for a general audience and are <strong>not directed to children under the age of 13</strong> (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recognize that our games may be accessed by minor children. We strongly advise that <strong>minor children should be supervised by a parent or legal guardian at all times</strong> while accessing our Services. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with personal information without their consent (such as signing up for the newsletter), they should contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:hugeholdings@hotmail.com">hugeholdings@hotmail.com</a>. We will take steps to promptly delete such information from our records.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

                <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

                <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hugeholdings@hotmail.com">hugeholdings@hotmail.com</a>.</p>
